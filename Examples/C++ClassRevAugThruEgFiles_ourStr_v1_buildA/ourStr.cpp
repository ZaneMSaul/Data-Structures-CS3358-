// FILE: ourStr.cpp
// CLASS IMPLEMENTED: ourStr (see ourStr.h for documentation)
// INVARIANT for the ourStr class:
//   1. Number of characters of the string represented by ourStr is in
//      member variable len.
//   2. For an empty string, we don't care what is stored in any of data;
//      for a non-empty string, the characters of the string (len of them,
//      from left to right) are stored in data[0] through data[len - 1]
//      and we don't care what's in the rest of data.
